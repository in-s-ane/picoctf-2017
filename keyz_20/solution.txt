Create an ssh key with `ssh-keygen -t rsa`. If you already have one, it's a simple matter of
copying the contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub on your local machine to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the remote.
Once that's complete, we can ssh from our local machine to the remote server.

$ ssh james9909@shell2017.picoctf.com
