We are given a java class file, which we can decompile using a tool such as jd-gui, or an online
website such as http://www.javadecompilers.com.

After decompiling the class file, we find a hidden method called get_flag(), which presumably
gives us the flag. We can either reverse engineer the encryption, or call the method
in the main method directly. I chose to do the latter.
