The name of the problem suggests that the server is checking our cookies and will display the flag if we have

<!-- Thankfully, we use a hidden one that is super PRIVATE, to protect our cookies.sqlite file -->

Sure enough, visiting shell2017.picoctf.com:46787/cookies.sqlite will allow us to download an sqlite file
We can load it up with sqlite and poke around the data. There's only one table, which makes things pretty straightforward.

$ sqlite3 cookies.sqlite
SQLite version 3.8.11.1 2015-07-29 20:00:57
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> .tables

sqlite> select * from moz_cookies;
1|localhost|0|0|ID|F3MAqpWxIvESiUNLHsflVd|localhost|/|1489365457|1489279130600290|1489279057101857|0|0

Changing the "ID" cookie to the string "F3MAqpWxIvESiUNLHsflVd" allows us to view the flag:
