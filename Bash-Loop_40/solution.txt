Running the binary tells us that we need to input a number between 0 and 4096.
We can brute force this fairly easily using bash.

The seq command will allow us to generate all numbers from 0 to x, which we can use
to solve the problem.

Yay! That's the number! Here be the flag: d968d0e2c5f8e01a252744cd80407392
