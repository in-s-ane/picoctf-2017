Looking at the packets in the pcap file, we see lots of pages and images being passed around.
Looking deeper into the traffic, there are two suspicious images: r7jTjJ51.png and TPf54ih0.png.
We can use wireshark to export the raw data in those two packets and view them as pngs.
Combine the text on both the images to get the flag.
