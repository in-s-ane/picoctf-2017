We need to provide an initial value for eax so that the program returns 1.

Inspecting the assembly, we see a loop.

    loop:
        test %eax, %eax
        jz fin
        add %ecx, %ebx
        dec %eax
        jmp loop

This loop jumps to the fin label when eax is zero, otherwise it adds the value of ecx to ebx, decrements eax, and continues the loop.

Looking at the conditions to jump to the good label, we see that
we need to set the value of ebx to 0x7ee0 (32480).

Our program looks somewhat like this:

eax = XXXXXXX
ebx = 0
ecx = 5
while eax != 0:
    ebx += ecx
    eax -= 1
if ebx == 32480:
    return 1
return 0

The correct value of eax to satisfy the necessary conditions is 32480/5 = 6496.

6496 in hexadecimal is 0x1960, which is our flag.
