We are given a list of usernames and passwords hashed with md5.
The problem suggests that the passwords aren't very strong, so we can try looking
up the hashes using an online database. I used https://www.hashkiller.co.uk/md5-decrypter.aspx

I picked a random person (christene), whose password turned out to be "p0lyp".

$ nc shell2017.picoctf.com 4534
enter username:
christene
christene's password:p0lyp
