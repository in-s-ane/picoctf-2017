The flag is unfairly blocked off at the end of the dungeon, so we can't pick it up legitimately.
In order to solve this, you need to know how picking up items works.

In game.js, we find the following chunk of code:

	if(entity.items.length < entity.stats.maxItems){
		var itId = -1;
		var name = "";
		for(var i = 0; i < state.items.length; i++){
			if(state.items[i].location.r == entity.location.r && state.items[i].location.c == entity.location.c){
				itId = state.items[i].id;
				msg.outcome.push({
					type: "item/get",
					id: state.items[i].id,
					item: state.items[i].name
				});
				break;
			}
		}
	}

	entity.items = entity.items.concat(state.items.filter(function(it){ return it.id == itId; }));
	state.items = state.items.filter(function(it){ return it.id != itId; });

This gives the player all the items that match a certain id. We can exploit this by picking up an item
with the same ID as the flag in another floor, going to the last floor, dropping and picking it back up again.

Looking at the list of objects in the developer console, we find that the ids are much lower than in previous
games, starting at 0 instead of 10000. It might take a while, because not all the floors will have
the minimum number of items required to spawn an item with the correct id.
