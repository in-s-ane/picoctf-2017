Like the last Toaster Wars problem, we can access the server source code, but we don't need it
to solve.

The last floor contains the flag, but we're not able to access it, as confirmed by the hint.
However, there is an enemy also on the floor who is able to access the flag, so we need to
coerce it to pick up the flag, and then kill it. You look at ai.js for how exactly the enemies move,
but it's not necessary. It's also important to make sure that the enemy doesn't end up too close
to you or you'll have to restart the game.
The trick is to circle around the flag, and move diagonally when rounding the corners to coerce the enemy
into the passage.

Toaster used the Flag!
A soft voice on the wind speaks to you: "The secret you are looking for is i_dont_want_to_say_goodbye__gets_me_every_time_2fa00d62583c852b0e5ae11dcdcbabe1. Use it wisely."
Toaster dropped the Cinnamon.
