The key to starting off the problem lies in the hint:

I think this game is running on a Node.js server. If it's configured poorly, you may be able to access the server's source. If my memory serves me correctly, Node servers have a special file that lists dependencies and a start command; maybe you can use that file to figure out where the other files are?

The special file is the "package.json" file, and trying to visit /package.json tells us that we are on the right track.

The "start" script runs the "server/serv.js" file, which we also have access to.
From this, we can get the source code of the server and start looking for vulnerabilities.

For this problem, the challenge is to figure out which of the many flag items is the correct one.

The first step is to figure out when the flag actually gets revealed.
In "game.js", we find the following in the executeItemUse function:

    case "revealFlag":
        if (entity.items[action.item].effects[i].check == 64) {
            outcome.flag = process.env["PICO_CTF_FLAG"];
        }
        break;

From this, we know that we need to pick up the flag that has an effect with the property "check" of 64.

Looking at "config.js", we find the createFlag function which sets the check property based off the first parameter.
We also see how the flags are generated:

    items: Array.from(new Array(83), (_, idx) => {
        if (idx >= 2) {
            idx++
        }

        if (idx >= 77) {
            idx++;
        }

        var r = Math.floor(idx / 5) + 1;
        var c = (idx % 5) + 1;

        return createFlag(idx, { r: r, c: c });
    }),

You can either reverse the check and figure out when idx+100 equals 64 and pick up the flag at those coordinates.

The alternate method for figuring out which flag is the right one is to print out all the items on the floor and check for the right flag by running:

> state.items

The right flag is the one at row 13, column 5.

Toaster used the Flag!
